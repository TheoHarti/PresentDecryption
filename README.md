This project is my attempts to make a christmas riddle for my family. I made websites in this repository and hosted it on github pages. They needed to solve the riddles to get 4 codes to decrypt the names on their presents. There is also a page for me to do the encryptions of their names. All the text is in german but we can talk and code in english. Currently I am working on the 2025 riddles and website and want you to help me.
